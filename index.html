    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), is an extremely rare genetic disorder that
      causes rapid aging in children. The disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1886 (J.
      Hutchinson) and 1897 (H. Gilford). It is primarily caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, which encodes a protein
      that helps maintain the structural integrity of the cell nucleus.</p>

      <h1>Genetics</h1>
      <div class="points">

        <div class="point-left">
          <h2>Autosomal Dominant Inheritance</h2>
          <p>Progeria follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means that a single copy of the mutated
            gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, Progeria is not inherited from the parents but
            arises as a spontaneous genetic mutation. However, there have been rare instances of familial cases where
            the condition is passed from one generation to the next.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point-right">
          <h2>LMNA Gene Mutation</h2>
          <p>Progeria is primarily caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene (Lamin A/C gene), which is located on
            chromosome 1. This gene provides instructions for making two related proteins, Lamin A and Lamin C, that
            are
            essential for maintaining the structure of the cell nucleus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point-left">
          <h2>Production of Progerin</h2>
          <p>The LMNA gene mutation in Progeria leads to the production of a faulty form of Lamin A protein called
            progerin. Progerin is a truncated and abnormal version of Lamin A. It accumulates within the cell nucleus
            and interferes with normal cellular functions. As a result, affected individuals experience rapid aging and
            a range of
            associated symptoms.</p>

    <h1>Diagnosing and Detecting</h1>
    <div>
      <p>A genetic test for changes in the LMNA gene can confirm the diagnosis of progeria.
        A thorough physical examination includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Measuring height and weight.</li>
        <li>Putting measurements on a growth curve chart.</li>
        <li>Testing hearing and vision.</li>
        <li>Measuring vital signs, including blood pressure.</li>
        <li>Looking for visible symptoms of progeria.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Incidence of Progeria</h1>
      <p>Progeria is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females equally, and all races equally. The
        prevalence of HGPS is approximately 1 in 20 million, so at any given time, there are approximately 400 children
        living with progeria worldwide. Two sets of affected identical twins have been reported in the literature. As of
        December 2020, the Progeria Research Foundation International Progeria Registry has identified a total of 131
        children and young adults living with progeria worldwide including 20 living in the US.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="treatment" id="treatment">
    <h1>Treatment</h1>
    <p>There's no cure for progeria. But regular monitoring for heart and blood vessel disease may help with managing
      the condition.<br><br>
      During medical visits, a person with progeria gets their weight and height measured and put on a chart that shows
      average measurements of people of that age. Routine evaluations often include electrocardiograms and
      echocardiograms to check the heart, imaging tests such as X-ray and MRI, and dental, vision and hearing
      exams.<br><br>
      Certain therapies may ease or delay some of the symptoms of progeria. These may include:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Lonafarnib (Zokinvy):</b> This oral medicine helps prevent the buildup of faulty progerin and progerin-like
        proteins in cells. Preventing this buildup in cells can slow the progression of symptoms that occur in progeria,
        which can help some children live longer. The medicine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
        children 1 year and older.</li><br>
      <li><b>Low-dose aspirin: </b>A daily dose may help prevent heart attacks and strokes.</li><br>
      <li><b>Physical and occupational therapy: </b>Physical therapy can help with joint stiffness and hip problems to
        help the person remain active. Occupational therapy can help to learn ways to manage daily activities, such as
        dressing, brushing teeth and eating.</li><br>
      <li><b>Nutrition: </b>A balanced diet that includes healthy, high-calorie foods can help maintain adequate
        nutrition. Sometimes nutrition supplements are needed to provide extra calories.</li><br>
      <li><b>Eye and vision care: </b>Not being able to close eyelids completely can cause dry eyes and damage to the
        surface of the eye. Moisturizing eye products and regular vision care can help.</li><br>
    </ul>
